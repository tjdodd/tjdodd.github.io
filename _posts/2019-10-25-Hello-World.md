This is my first Blog post. 

My name is Thomas Dodd, I'm currently a student at The Studio, Liverpool studying Animation, Game Design & VFX. I love animals, art and making things.
This Blog will be the home of updates on my work, events I attend and anything else that happens to be on my mind.

Have fun looking around!
