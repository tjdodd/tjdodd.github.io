Practicing drawing body drawing without reference

Welcome to my first real blog post!

I'm still getting used to jekyll (the platform for this site) so this took longer to post than I care to admit.

Anyway, today I decided to work on figure drawing. It's something I've wanted to get good at for a while now, and I'm starting to get good at it. I think. I'm definitely improving, anyway.

Here are my most sucessful attempts:

I'm aware that failing is part of the process, but there's still something inherently embarrasing about it. There's at least 2 full photoshop pages of 'failure' before these successful attempts.

For the first one I used a technique from a MikeyMegaMega tutorial video in which he shows a way of making anime-esque figures. I start off with a neck & head, and extend a spine out from underneath. Then, I add the ribcage and pelvis region and connect them with smooth lines. The stomach usually pushes outward in the facing direction and pulls in in the opposite. I don't know the exact terminology for this stuff.
One issue with this style is that I struggle to connect the arms and head.

The second technique I came up with by looking at a bunch of tumblr tutorials, i don't remember the exact information but it was something like:
* draw circles for: the upper torso, lower torso, shoulders, knees and elbows.
* connect the upper & lower torso using triangles to indicate the slope of the mid torso, then smooth that out.
* connect the shoulders to elbows using straight lines, and then draw a weird figure-8 to make the forearm and hands.

I don't think it went into detail about the legs but I already have that figured out. One thing I'm noticing now though is that neither of the figures have knees.

I'm still just starting out so I'm just starting to *figure* this stuff out. At some point I'll be great, and this will all be worth it.

Thank you for reading, have a good day.
